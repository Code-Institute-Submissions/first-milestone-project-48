# Gemini Gymnastic Club Website

Gemini Gymnastic club provides gymnastic, trampolining and free g coaching in structured and fun classes for 800 members.  The members range from babies with their parents 
through to adults currently and the club are always looking for new members to join them.

The website has been designed in consultation with the club owners.  The website provides a colourful, informative and easy to use place for existing
members and to attract new members wanting to enquire or start gymnastics, trampolining, free g or a combination of all classes.

In addition to the club's class offerings, they also have a coffee bar, organise birthday parties and hire the club to other organisations or for events.  The website enables people
interested in these facilities.  The website provides the opportunity for the club to receive enquiries and bookings to maximise these facilities.
 
## UX
 
In establishing the site for the project, I met with the club owners and shared the level of my development learning so far and the opportunity for me to build them a website for their 
existing members and also to attract new members to their club.

Discussions progressed into what they wanted to achieve and how my project could assist them. It was agreed that a website would be beneficial for the following key areas:

- A site for existing club members to view other classes available
- A site for parents to also view other classes and facilities of the club
- A site to be shared with friends and family to obtain new members to the club
- A site to attract new members searching to start gymnastics, trampolining or free g in the local area
- Promote the coffee bar area, birthday parties and to hire the club, increasing awareness and revenue
- Enable easy access to send enquiries, make bookings or register interest in a class
- Identify members who would be interested in receiving a newsletter 
- Provide links to the clubs social media sites
- Provide a basis to add more content and features in the future

We worked collaboratively on generating the user stories below to establish the key requirements of the project and how the site could achieve their goals with my current 
level of skillset.  We prioritised the functionality making sure it provided a clear, informative and structured site which could be progressed and enhanced in the future
but still achieved the result they wanted immediately.

Wireframe diagrams were hand drawn to establish how the site would flow, the pages involved and the content required for each to achieve the key areas. These are provided
below also.

Progress was reviewed and feedback obtained from the club owners throughout the project lifecycle and development of the site.
