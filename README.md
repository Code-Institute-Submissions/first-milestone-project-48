# Gemini Gymnastic Club Website

Gemini Gymnastic club provides gymnastic, trampolining and free g coaching in structured and fun classes for 800 members.  The members range from babies with their parents 
through to adults currently and the club are always looking for new members to join them.

The website has been designed in consultation with the club owners.  The website provides a colourful, informative and easy to use place for existing
members and to attract new members wanting to enquire or start gymnastics, trampolining, free g or a combination of all classes.

In addition to the club's class offerings, they also have a coffee bar, organise birthday parties and hire the club to other organisations or for events.  The website enables people
interested in these facilities.  The website provides the opportunity for the club to receive enquiries and bookings to maximise these facilities.
 
## UX
 
In establishing the site for the project, I met with the club owners and shared the level of my development learning so far and the opportunity for me to build them a website for their 
existing members and also to attract new members to their club.

Discussions progressed into what they wanted to achieve and how my project could assist them. It was agreed that a website would be beneficial for the following key areas:

- A site for existing club members to view other classes available
- A site for parents to also view other classes and facilities of the club
- A site to be shared with friends and family to obtain new members to the club
- A site to attract new members searching to start gymnastics, trampolining or free g in the local area
- Promote the coffee bar area, birthday parties and to hire the club, increasing awareness and revenue
- Enable easy access to send enquiries, make bookings or register interest in a class
- Identify members who would be interested in receiving a newsletter 
- Provide links to the clubs social media sites
- Provide a basis to add more content and features in the future

We worked collaboratively on generating the user stories below to establish the key requirements of the project and how the site could achieve their goals with my current 
level of skillset.  We prioritised the functionality making sure it provided a clear, informative and structured site which could be progressed and enhanced in the future
but still achieved the result tehy wanted immediately.

Wireframe diagrams were hand drawn to establish how the site would flow, the pages involved and the content required for each to achieve the key areas. These are provided
below also.

Progress was reviewed and feedback obtained from the club owners throughout the project lifecycle and development of the site.

### User Stories (To do)

- As a owner, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- As a owner,

- As a member,

- As a parent,


### Initial Wireframes (To do)
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.


## Features (To do)

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features (To do)
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement (To do)
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used (To do)
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- HTML & CSS 
- Bootstrap
- Fontawesome
- Fancybox
- CDNJS 

## Testing (To do)
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment (To do)
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
